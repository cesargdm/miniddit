> Frontend Engineering Take-Home Project built with React

This project is built with [Parcel](https://parceljs.org), I wanted to try this alternative to Webpack because it has the new React fast refresh support. Also using beta of React Router DOM and it works just fine.

## Running

> Node 12, and modern browser with fetch support is required

Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

Run development mode

```bash
npm start
```

## Testing

```bash
npm run test -- --watch
```

## Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Extra features

- Used new UI from reddit
- Dark mode support (with OS settings)
- Shrink comment threads like Reddit
- Created a pair of cool tests (not completed tested)
